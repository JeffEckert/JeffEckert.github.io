So the time began to start my next project.  I knew a few weeks in to studying Sinatra that we were going to make a website that tracked something that was important to us.  At that moment I had an idea to build a site that catalogs information about my favorite topic "Disney World".  From there I began to think about how I wanted my site to look.  I started by going to diagrams.net and working out a loose structure of how I wanted it to look.  

I knew it had to be a site that a user could set up and sign into and could track an item.  So I created a diagram that showed I needed a user DB that would have a username and password for each user.  I then connected to another DB that would track an Attraction entry for attractions at the park,  including the park it was at, notes and a photo.  I did show in my diagram that each user would have many attractions but each attraction belonged to a user.  

From there I was off,  I built my App framework using corneal and began working on my Models, Views and controllers.  I created several of each.   I had seperate controllers for users, attractions and sessions.  Two models one for users and one for attractions and a fair amount of views to go with all.  In the end I believe the site came out the way I wanted and met the requirements.  I look forward to getting some good feedback!
