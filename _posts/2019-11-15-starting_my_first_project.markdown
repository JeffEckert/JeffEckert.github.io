I am beginning to work on my first project here at Flatiron.  That project is a CLI application where it will either use an API or scrape data from a website at least one layer deep on any subject in an application for a given topic.  Everything I hear pushes me to go the API route but I am nervous as I have never used an API before.  Truely I am nervous about this whole experience because I feel like I am Wholly unprepared.  I'm sure it is just nerves but as soon as I started going through the initial project instructions I felt like I knew none of this and my mind was drawing a blank.  

   The first part of the project I was going through was how to set up an application using Bundler and I was immediately nervous about the prospect.  I use github and the local environment now but this was different.  This was creating something new.  No labs or tests to lean on,  just a binking curser and me.  That was super un-nerving.  But I was able to get through my initial set up of bundler and my app with ease and I am on my way.  
	 
I thought this would be an appropriate time to write my first blog because this is the first time I have felt truely alone in this endevor of learning code.  I know this is just the fear of the unknown, but it is truly the first time I have felt unprepaired in some time.  I think my next step will be to write out an outline for the project.  Diagram it out and write some suedocode so I know where I am going and how I am going to get there.  Either Way I will make another blog towards the end of this project to talk more about how it went.  Wish me luck!
