In my final project for Flatiron I wanted to make a website that could be used in my life or someone I knew.  My wife works a side business so I decided on an inventory tracker. I chose this type of app because I knew that when I was wireframing it out I could see the distinct fetchs I was going to have to run.  One thing that I always had trouble with when building a site in javascript was styling the site.  So when I got to the point of adding a framework and styling it out.  When I worked with Javascript the Framework I chose to work with was Bootstrap and although there was alot of information about different options you would have There was so much that I needed to start with an already built theme and work from there.  When you style with javascript you generally put all of your styling code in either index.html or index.css.  I wasnt sure if that type of method would work for React or how to implement it.  

After a bit of searching the web I found that there was a version of bootstrap made specificly for react. That was called react-bootstrap.  It was technically its own framework but it was built off the bootstrap platform.   The difference is with react you can add your styling jsx code right in to each component or build your own for areas that need more data.  I installed the framework using npm install react-bootstrap and got to work.  I was able to add a navbar component and styalize it very cleanly and quickly.  I built a homepage component where I was able to explain my site and link to all areas through my navbar.  I cleaned up all of my forms and gave the site a uniformed look.  It was very straightforward and easy to use.  I would use react-bootstrap again in a heartbeat.
