On the last few projects one thing I struggled with was making my final product look polished and new.  I have always struggled with CSS when programming my site views.  I know in theory how CSS should work.  You would mark your html Items with a div class and then reference them on a style sheet with CSS variables to manipulate their look.  Everytime I tried to do this I would always feel that my site looked like something from Aol circa 2001 and not like something modern like instagram or Airbnb.  As I was working on my javascript project I started researching CSS fameworks.  

I found that there were a bunch of different options but I narrowed my search down to Bulma and Bootstrap.  I liked what both provided for choices but ultimately decided to go with bootstrap.  Once all of my javascript coding was done I moved to start "prettying up" my site. The first thing I thought I should do is wireframe my site, so I used a site called fluid UI to do so.  Wireframing is where you set up an outline of what you want your page to look like so you can build from there. Next, I went through the bootstrap docs and found that they had sample projects using the bootstrap framework and so I downloaded the source code of the samples and chose the one that most closely matched my wireframe.  From there it was a matter of plug and play.  I added the source code to a new index.html and index.css file and began to plug my html into the sourcecode to move my javascript to the new framework.  

Obviously the sample wasnt an exact match to my wireframe so from there I went through the bootstrap components and grabbed source code to help add a dropdown and change some colors as well as create a really nice card for my renders from my javascript.  All in all this is the most professional looking site I have ever created and I cant wait to use it more to build better looking sites.
